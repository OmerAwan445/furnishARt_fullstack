## How to Run the Project


### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js** and **npm** (or yarn) installed.

2.  **PostgreSQL** database.

3.  **Docker** installed for containerization.

4.  **Cloudflare** R2 setup for asset storage.

  


### Steps

**1. Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/OmerAwan445/furnishARt_fullstack.git
cd furnishARt_fullstack
``` 

**2. Set up the backend:**

```
cd backend 
npm install
npm run dev
```
**3. Set up the frontend:**

``` 
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
``` 

**4. Set up environment variables:**

- Create a `.env` file in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories.

- Configure them based on the `.env.example` file provided in each directory

  

**5. Initialize the database:**

- Run the SQL queries provided in the `insert_dummy_data.sql` file to insert dummy data

  

**6. Run the project:**

- After completing the setup, you can run the frontend and backend using the commands specified above (`npm run dev`), or you can run the project using Docker Compose (preferred for production).

  

### Running with Docker Compose

  

To run the entire project with Docker Compose, follow these steps:

  

**1. Build the Docker images:**

```
docker-compose build
```

**2. Start the containers:**

``` 
docker-compose up
```

**3. Insert Dummy Data in DB**

-  **Navigate to the database container:**

```
docker exec -it furnishart-db sh
```

-  **Log in to the Postgres database and Create DB:**

```
psql -U postgres -d posgtres
CREATE DATABASE furnishart-db;
```

Now insert dummy data queries from `insert_dummy_data.sql` file.

  

This will automatically set up the backend, frontend, and database as defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

  

### Frontend Deployment

  

- The frontend is live and hosted on **Vercel**. Access it here: [furniARt on Vercel](https://furnishart.vercel.app/).

  

### Backend Deployment

  

- The backend is live on an **AWS t2.micro** instance.

  

### Note on Performance

  

Since all components of the project (backend, frontend, and assets) are hosted on free-tier services (AWS t2.micro, Vercel, and Cloudflare R2), the live demo might experience slower performance.
